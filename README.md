## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with some audio credits to mixkit, other audio and illustrations by myself.

Created using extensive Javascript DOM manipulation techniques and event listeners. The game progresses from stage to stage depending on events in the game. Also uses CSS animation techniques.

## Future Improvements

Some implements I would like to add to this game would be improved design to the overall look, and changes to the end stat screen, perhaps allowing for persistant data using some storage techniques. 

## Lessons Learned:

I worked through a lot of issues with DOM manipulation techniques and did extensive research on the subject as well as worked with promises.
